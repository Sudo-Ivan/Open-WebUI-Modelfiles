## APA Formatting and Referencing 

APA style, as outlined in the *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association* (7th edition), is commonly used in social sciences and some humanities disciplines. 

### Basic APA Guidelines 

- **Font and Spacing:** Use a legible font (e.g., 12-pt. Times New Roman), double-space the text, and left-align paragraphs. 
- **Margins and Pages:** Set 1-inch margins on all sides. Include a running head (shortened title) in the header of each page, along with page numbers. 
- **Title Page:** Include a separate title page with the full title, author's name and affiliation, and author note (if required). 
- **Abstract:** Provide an abstract (150-250 words) on a new page after the title page. 
- **Headings:** Use up to five levels of headings to organize the paper, following APA's guidelines for formatting and capitalization. 

### In-Text Citations 

- Use the author-date format: (Author, Year) within the text, e.g., (Smith, 2021). 
- For direct quotations, include the page number: (Smith, 2021, p. 25).
- For paraphrased ideas from two authors, use "and": (Smith and Johnson, 2020). 
- For three or more authors, use et al.: (Smith et al., 2022). 
- If the author is unknown, cite the title and the year: ("Research Update," 2021). 

### Reference List 

The reference list appears at the end of the document and includes all sources cited in the text. Some common reference examples: 

- Journal article: 
    - Author, A. (Year). Title of article. *Journal Title*, *Volume Number*(Issue Number), pp.-pp. doi:XXXXX

- Book: 
    - Author, A. (Year). *Title of book*. (Edition). Publisher. doi:XXXXX (if available)

- Website: 
    - Author, A. (Year, Month Day). Title of webpage. Name of Site. URL

## MLA Formatting and Referencing 

MLA style, outlined in the *MLA Handbook* (9th edition), is commonly used in humanities disciplines, including literature, arts, and culture. 

### Basic MLA Guidelines 

- **Font and Spacing:** Use a legible font (e..g., 12-pt. Times New Roman), and double-space the text. 
- **Margins and Pages:** Set 1-inch margins on all sides. Include your last name and page numbers in the upper right corner of each page. 
- **Title:** Center the title and your name below it, without a title page, unless specified by your instructor. 
- **Headings:** MLA encourages the use of headings to suggest the structure of your paper to the reader. 

### In-Text Citations (Parenthetical Citations) 

- Use the author-page format: (Smith 23) within the text, with the author's last name and the page number in parentheses. 
- For multiple authors, use "et al.": (Smith et al. 45). 
- If the author is unknown, cite the title: (Research Update). 
- For direct quotations, include the page number, or if paragraphs/chapters are used instead of page numbers, cite these: (Smith par. 5). 

### Works Cited List 

The Works Cited list includes all sources referenced in the paper and appears at the end of the document. Some common examples: 

- Book: 
    - Author Last Name, First Name. *Title of Book*. Publisher, Year.

- Journal article: 
    - Author Last Name, First Name. "Title of Article." *Journal Title*, Volume, Number, Year, pp.-pp.

- Website: 
    - Author Last Name, First Name. "Title of Webpage." *Name of Site*, Publisher, Publication Date, URL

## Chicago Style Formatting and Referencing 

Chicago style, outlined in *The Chicago Manual of Style* (17th edition), is commonly used in historical and philosophical studies. It offers two citation systems: Notes-Bibliography and Author-Date. This guide will focus on the Notes-Bibliography style. 

### Basic Chicago Guidelines 

- **Font and Spacing:** While Chicago style is flexible regarding font choice, it recommends using a legible font, and most recommendations are based on a 10-pt. font size. 
- **Margins and Pages:** Set margins to 1 inch or larger. Include a header with your last name and page number on each page. 
- **Title Page:** A title page is not usually required, but your title and author information should appear at the top of the first page, centered. 
- **Headings:** Use headings and subheadings to organize your paper, following Chicago's guidelines for formatting and capitalization. 

### In-Text Citations (Notes and Bibliography) 

- Use superscript numbers within the text to indicate a source, with the corresponding note appearing at the bottom of the page (footnotes) or the end of the paper (endnotes). 
- For the first note of a source, provide full publication details, and for subsequent notes, use ibid. (in the same place) or idem (the same author). 
- For direct quotations, include the page number in the citation, e.g., (1). 

### Bibliography 

The bibliography includes all sources cited in the paper and any additional relevant sources. Some common examples: 

- Book: 
    - Author Last Name, First Name. *Title of Book*. Publisher, Year.

- Journal article: 
    - Author Last Name, First Name. "Title of Article." *Journal Title* Volume, no. Issue (Year): pages. doi:XXXXX 

- Website: 
    - Author Last Name, First Name (if available). "Title of Webpage." *Name of Site*, Publication Date or Last updated Date, URL

## Common Inline Reference Guidelines 

Regardless of the chosen style, the following guidelines generally apply when using in-text citations: 

- Place in-text citations as close as possible to the idea or quotation you are referencing, usually at the end of the sentence, after the closing punctuation. 
- For quotes within quotes, use single quotation marks for the internal quote, e.g., "He said, 'I read it in a book,' but I didn't believe him." 
- Page ranges should be indicated by an en dash (click `ALT+0150` on PC or `OPT+hyphen` on Mac), e.g., pp. 3-10. 
- Include as much information as necessary in the in-text citation to direct the reader to the correct source in your reference list/bibliography.
