Minimal
The Minimal example demonstrates the bare-minimum setup required to connect to a Reticulum network from your program. In about five lines of code, you will have the Reticulum Network Stack initialised, and ready to pass traffic in your program.

Channel
The Channel example explores using a Channel to send structured data between peers of a Link.

##########################################################
# This RNS example demonstrates how to set up a link to  #
# a destination, and pass structured messages over it    #
# using a channel.                                       #
##########################################################

import RNS
from RNS.vendor import umsgpack

# Let's define an app name. We'll use this for all
# destinations we create. Since this echo example
# is part of a range of example utilities, we'll put
# them all within the app namespace "example_utilities"
APP_NAME = "example_utilities"

##########################################################
#### Shared Objects ######################################
##########################################################

# Channel data must be structured in a subclass of
# MessageBase. This ensures that the channel will be able
# to serialize and deserialize the object and multiplex it
# with other objects. Both ends of a link will need the
# same object definitions to be able to communicate over
# a channel.
#
# Note: The objects we wish to use over the channel must
# be registered with the channel, and each link has a
# different channel instance. See the client_connected
# and link_established functions in this example to see
# how message types are registered.

# Let's make a simple message class called StringMessage
# that will convey a string with a timestamp.

class StringMessage(RNS.MessageBase):
    # The MSGTYPE class variable needs to be assigned a
    # 2 byte integer value. This identifier allows the
    # channel to look up your message's constructor when a
    # message arrives over the channel.
    #
    # MSGTYPE must be unique across all message types we
    # register with the channel. MSGTYPEs >= 0xf000 are
    # reserved for the system.
    MSGTYPE = 0x0101

    # The constructor of our object must be callable with
    # no arguments. We can have parameters, but they must
    # have a default assignment.
    #
    # This is needed so the channel can create an empty
    # version of our message into which the incoming
    # message can be unpacked.
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()

    # Finally, our message needs to implement functions
    # the channel can call to pack and unpack our message
    # to/from the raw packet payload. We'll use the
    # umsgpack package bundled with RNS. We could also use
    # the struct package bundled with Python if we wanted
    # more control over the structure of the packed bytes.
    #
    # Also note that packed message objects must fit
    # entirely in one packet. The number of bytes
    # available for message payloads can be queried from
    # the channel using the Channel.MDU property. The
    # channel MDU is slightly less than the link MDU due
    # to encoding the message header.

    # The pack function encodes the message contents into
    # a byte stream.
    def pack(self) -> bytes:
        return umsgpack.packb((self.data, self.timestamp))

    # And the unpack function decodes a byte stream into
    # the message contents.
    def unpack(self, raw):
        self.data, self.timestamp = umsgpack.unpackb(raw)

Filetransfer
The Filetransfer example implements a basic file-server program that allow clients to connect and download files. The program uses the Resource interface to efficiently pass files of any size over a Reticulum Link.

##########################################################
# This RNS example demonstrates a simple filetransfer    #
# server and client program. The server will serve a     #
# directory of files, and the clients can list and       #
# download files from the server.                        #
#                                                        #
# Please note that using RNS Resources for large file    #
# transfers is not recommended, since compression,       #
# encryption and hashmap sequencing can take a long time #
# on systems with slow CPUs, which will probably result  #
# in the client timing out before the resource sender    #
# can complete preparing the resource.                   #
#                                                        #
# If you need to transfer large files, use the Bundle    #
# class instead, which will automatically slice the data #
# into chunks suitable for packing as a Resource.        #
